Hello!
This is my Django pet-project - currency exchanger UAH to USD.

On the main page there is a history of exchange rates.
You can enter your exchange rate by selecting "Add new exchange rate" in the navigation bar.
And see the table of currency fluctuations on the "Fluctuations" page.

Good luck!
